# Hand-Action-Recognizer
This project comes with a inbuild GUI system where mute persons can show their hand gestures to AI and AI will detect the corresponding action and display it on screen. Here our AI can recognize  only 10 actions - Yes, No, okay, rock, bro, no war please, hello, stop there ,call me, proud of JISCE. The last action is a tribute to my engineering collage JIS Collage of Engineering.

Main file is GUI.py. A GUI app will open when the file will be executed.

User need to show their hand actions on cam to get the recognitions.   		

for yes - thumbs up,
for no - thumbs down.
for okay - make circle with thumb and index finger tip and raise the rest of fingers.
for no war please - victory sign with index and middle finger.
for rock - make a fist and raise index and little finger.
for hello - open and raise all fingers casuallly (just like hello).
for stop there - close the gaps between fingers in hello sign and move hands towars the screen. 
for call me - make a call sign with thumb and little fingr.
for bro - show the fist.
for proud of jisce = raise thumb and index finger just like holding a gun and show the back side of hand to cam.
